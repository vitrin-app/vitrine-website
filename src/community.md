<i>A Safe Environemnt</i>

Vitrine is a safe and trustworthy place of trade and exchange for students, so you need an academic email to be able to 
post listings or contact private listings:

```
- max.mustermann@tum.de

- jane.doe@cs.usc.edu
```

We already support most universities across the globe, but if your
university or academic institute is missing, send us an email at [support@vitrine.cloud](mailto:support@vitrine.cloud)
and we will gladly get you covered!

Only members can post videos to Vitrine. If you are a member (you have a university email), you can
choose to post privately, which means only other members will be able to access your contact information.
If you want a wider audience, you can also choose to post publicly, allowing anyone who sees your listing
to contact you.

Not an academic? No worries, you still can browse listings on Vitrine and contact public listings.
