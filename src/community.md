Vitrine is a safe and trustworthy place of trade and exchange. so you need a verified email address to be able to 
post listings or contact private listings:

```

Only members can post videos to Vitrine. If you are a member (valid email address), you can
choose to post privately, which means only other members will be able to access your contact information.
If you want a wider audience, you can also choose to post publicly, allowing anyone who sees your listing
to contact you.
